## FastPay Overview

FastPay is a Dapp that enables users and small businesses to sell easily on Minipay!

## Problem

Users on Minipay can only share phone numbers to receive payments. This is not convenient for users or small businesses who also want to track both payments and inventory.

## Solution

FastPay lets users create listings, share links, and receive CUSD payments directly to their Minipay wallet. It's great for small businesses, donations, and community contributions.
